# Introduction

fiji_tracker is a small package to track and quantify cells in fiji.
This is a small project being used for me to refresh my thinking in python
as well as assist Jacques Augenstreich with some of his work quantifying
some of his really cool work which seeks to interrogate bacteria inside
macrophages with respect to time.
